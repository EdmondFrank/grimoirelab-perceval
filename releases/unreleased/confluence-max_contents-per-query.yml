title: '[confluence] Option `max_contents` to limit the number of requested contents'
category: added
author: Quan Zhou <quan@bitergia.com>
issue: null
notes: >
    This parameter sets the maximum number of contents requested
    per query. By default, this number is 200, but this can be changed by
    adding the `--max-contents` argument. This will help to bypass those
    instances where the maximum limit is lower than Perceval's default
    value.
