title: '[bugzillarest] Failback when checking custom instances'
category: fixed

notes: >
    Some Bugzilla instances return a HTTP 400 error when checking
    if their are custom instances or not. On those cases, the backend will
    capture the error and consider the version of that Bugzilla instance
    as custom.
